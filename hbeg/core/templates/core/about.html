        <div class="is-size-3 is-bold"> How to use the HBEG search engine<sup>Beta</sup> </div>
        <div class="content is-size-5">
            The search engine is designed to require minimal effort to find a story that you're looking for. Thus, you can <strong>simply search for a story title and you will get the best results that get matched!</strong><br>
         </div>   
            <div class="content is-size-5">
                <strong>Let's take an example.</strong> Say I am searching for a fic titled 'World Changer'. I can simply type and enter: <i>world changer</i> in the search and get what I'm looking for. <br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="content is-size-4 is-bold mb-4">
                <u>That's good, but can I search for more than just the title?</u> 
            </div>
            <div class="content is-size-5">
                Yes, you can! <br> Now, let's imagine that I don't remember the whole title of the story. If I only type: 'world', I'll get a multitude of relevant or non-relevant results. I can obviously do a little better. 
                <div class="content is-size-5 mt-3 is-bold">
                    With that in mind, here are some simple ways to do a rather specialised search:
                    <ul id="about-feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Pair search</strong>: If the story that you want comes with a specific ship, then mention it in the search. Like with the previous example, I can type: <i>world harmony</i>, as I know that the story is harmony based.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search by author</strong>:If you remember the author's name even partially, just mention it in the search with the prefix <strong>a:</strong>. In the example that we're going with, I know who the author of the story is. So I can search for: <i>world a:arielriddle</i>  or even <i>world harmony a:arielriddle</i>. Any one of them should give me the results that I'm looking for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search by length</strong>:You can also filter stories based on a specific length by using the prefix <strong>l:</strong>. Type <i>l:short</i> for stories less than 50k words, <i>l:medium</i> for stories between 50k to 100k words and <i>l:long</i> for stories of more than 100k words.</li>
                        <li>You can also <strong>mention a few words of the summary</strong> in the search to narrow down your results even further.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            
            </div>
            <div class="content is-size-5">
                <div class="content is-size-4 is-bold mb-4"><u>Can I combine the above methods to search?</u> </div>
                Yup! You can also combine any of the above methods or use them individually to browse a general list of stories. For instance, you can use  <i>l:long harmony</i> to get stories greater than 100k words and with the pairing harmony. 
            </div>
            <div class="content is-size-5">
                Don't fret if don't find what you're looking for though. The search engine is still developing, and with time, it'll get better at knowing what you want. Until then, well, google isn't going anywhere, and nor are the other readers in the community. Take help if you can, we're all happy to put our minds together in finding an awesome, forgotten story :D.
